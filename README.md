# User_interface_menu
Overview
The User Interface Menu is an interactive Python project that provides a user-friendly interface to explore and manipulate fundamental data structures:

Linked List
Stack
Queue
The application supports two modes:

Terminal-Based Interface: For direct interaction through the command line.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A visually intuitive system built with Tkinter to demonstrate real-time operations on data structures.
This project showcases advanced programming concepts, error handling, and GUI development, making it a valuable addition to any portfolio.

Features
Linked List
Insert nodes at the beginning or end of the list.
Delete nodes by student ID.
Display all nodes, showing detailed student information:
Name
Gender
ID
Age
Stack
Push student nodes onto the stack.
Pop the top node off the stack.
Display all nodes in the stack with complete details.
Queue
Enqueue student nodes into the queue.
Dequeue the front node from the queue.
Display all nodes in the queue with detailed information.
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Modern design using Tkinter.
Dynamic real-time updates for:
Adding nodes.
Deleting nodes.
Displaying the current state of the data structure.
Maintains data integrity and visualization when navigating menus.
Error Handling
Validates user input (e.g., name, gender, ID, age).
Handles invalid operations gracefully (e.g., deleting from an empty stack or queue).
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Modules:
tkinter for GUI development.
Custom implementations for:
LinkedList
Stack
Queue
Node
Student

Future Enhancements Goals:

Binary Trees
Graphs
Include sorting and searching algorithms.
Add animations for data structure operations in the GUI.
